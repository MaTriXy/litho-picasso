# Litho - Picasso
Litho Picasso is a Litho compatible library, which provides an Image Component compatible with Picasso. Litho-PicassoX supports a wide part of Picasso's functionality and is compatible with Android X. If you notice that anything is missing ping me :)

## How to use

Add the following dependency on your app's `build.gradle`:
```gradle
implementation 'com.github.charbgr:litho-picassox:1.0'
```

Add PicassoImage component on your own Component :)

```java
PicassoImage.create(componentContext)
    .imageUrl(image)
    .fit(true)
    .centerCrop(true)
    .buildWithLayout();
```

[Here](https://github.com/charbgr/litho-picasso/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/github/charbgr/litho_picasso_component_sample/lithography/PicassoSingleImageComponentSpec.java) you can find a sample ComponentSpec that uses PicassoImage component.
